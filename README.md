Abstract: More than half of the world population lives in cities. Nearly one billion people within this urban population live in informal communities that are generally not documented, lack land tenure, and are often beyond the reach of government services and infrastructure. Concurrent to this trend, maps and geospatial databases are now recognized as powerful tools to aid community planning, mitigate poverty, assist in public health initiatives, and establish land tenure. This paper explores how drone survey technology in conjunction with established participatory mapping methodologies can facilitate the self-documentation of the informal urban community of Las Flores in Barranquilla, Colombia. We ask how insights from participatory mapping, cartografía social, urban planning and indigenous data governance come together in this informal urban setting. Our goal is to outline an interdisciplinary approach to “map the vernacular” which can enable more environmentally sustainable and socially just development during periods of intense urbanization.
Keywords: participatory mapping, drone survey, Colombia, data governance, cartografía social
